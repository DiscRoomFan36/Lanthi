------- Easy Stuff -------

Add Temporary storage to the context and use it more.

Make a reporting module. stop just asserting everywhere.

Change how the AST works, make everything an expression (i know what i mean)

make the compiling more recursive.
make printing more recursive

Use a string builder to make the output file. so we can do more things in one pass.



------- For the Future -------

Add a type system (another step in the chain.)

Add an IR thats not just C (another step in the chain.)

make a preload file. (to maybe just define printf)
