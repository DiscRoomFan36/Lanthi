------- Easy Stuff -------

Add Temporary storage to the context and use it more. no SV free in the middle of some random function.

Add reporting to AST.c
Add reporting to Compile.c

Change how the AST works, make everything an expression (i know what i mean)

make the compiling more recursive.
make printing more recursive

Use a string builder to make the output file. so we can do more things in one pass.

parse command line flags.


------- For the Future -------

Add a type system (another step in the chain.)

Add an IR thats not just C (another step in the chain.)

make a preload file. (to maybe just define printf)
